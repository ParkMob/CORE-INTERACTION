				One LP down and I'm still driving this 306<br> 
				I thought by now I'd upgrade put it on my plastics<br> 
				Yeah that's right I got more than one<br> 
				Oh fuck it let's go have some fun<br> 
				One record down and I'm riding in this piece of shit<br> 
				I thought by now I'd upgrade put it on my plastics<br> 
				Yeah that's right I got more than one<br> 
				Oh fuck it let's go have some fun<br> 
				Five gears, five doors, a tape player<br> 
				Now at the time I thought it couldn't get better<br> 
				You probably heard me when I drove right past<br> 
				Windows down money trees on full blast<br> 
				She's no Merc, she's no Jag, or a Beamer<br> 
				But we all know that we've got to start somewhere<br> 
				<br> 
				And I'm just happy getting A to B<br> 
				Kinda sucky having mum drive me <br> 
				Now I know there is an age gap<br> 
				But I'm pretty sure that we can see past that <br> 
				I don't care if there's a problem with your body<br> 
				'Cause it's what goes on inside that matters to me<br> 
				Don't I know you like to drink up<br> 
				You could guzzle down that juice and never wake up<br> 
				But I know deep down you wanna make me happy<br> 
				It's all you ever wanna do<br> 
				<br> 
				One LP down and I'm still driving this 306<br> 
				I thought by now I'd upgrade put it on my plastics<br> 
				Yeah that's right I got more than one<br> 
				Oh fuck it let's go have some fun<br>

				Yeah that's right I got more than one<br> 
				Oh fuck it let's go have some fun<br> 
				Five gears, five doors, a tape player<br> 
				<br> 
				Now at the time I thought <br> 
				What did I know I was seventeen<br> 
				I was young I only had my dreams<br> 
				It felt good to be out and get with it<br> 
				I'm getting outta here and this is my ticket<br> 
				You probably knew me more than anyone here<br> 
				Well you were pretty much my teenage years<br> 
				Will take work to make work what we got<br> 
				Will take love and affection yeah a lot<br> 
				Will take blood will take sweat will take tears<br> 
				Will take a ton shit over the years<br> 
				Will take knocks will take bruises and beats<br> 
				You'd take my first time on your backseat<br> 
				And you thought your days were done<br> 
				<br> 
				Oh oh, oh fuck it let's go have some fun<br> 
				Oh fuck it let's go have some fun<br> 
				And you thought your days were done<br> 
				Oh fuck it let's go have some fun<br> 
				One LP down and I'm still driving this 306<br> 
				I thought by now I'd upgrade put it on my plastics<br> 
				Yeah that's right I got more than one<br> 
				Oh fuck it let's go have some fun<br>
