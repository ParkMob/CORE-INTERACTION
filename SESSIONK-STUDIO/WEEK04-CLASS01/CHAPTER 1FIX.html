			Your eye, first of all, would glide over the <strong> grey fitted carpet </strong> in the 
			<ol>
			<li> narrow </li>
			<li> long and </li>
			<li> high-ceilinged corridor. </li>
			</ol>


			Its walls would be <strong> cupboards,</strong> in light-coloured wood, with <strong> fittings of gleaming brass.</strong> 
			<strong> Three prints,  </strong> depicting,
			<ol>
				<li>
			respectively, the Derby winner Thunderbird, </li>
			<li> a paddle-steamer named Villede-Motitereau, </li>
			<li> and a Stephenson locomotive, </li>
			</ol>

			would lead to a <strong> leather curtain hanging </strong> 
			<ul>
			<li> on thick, </li>
				<li> black, </li>
				<li> grainy wooden rings </li> which would slide back at the merest touch. 
				</ul>

			There, the <strong> carpet</strong> would give way to an almost 
			<ul>
			<li> yellow woodblock floor,</li>
			<li> partly covered by <strong>  three faded rugs.</strong> </li>
			</ul> </p>

			<p>  It would be a living room about twenty three feet long by ten feet wide. 
			On the <strong> left,</strong> in a <em> kind of recess</em>, there would be a 
			<ul>
			<li> <storng> large sofa</storng> upholstered in worn black leather, with pale cherrywood bookcases on either side, 
				heaped with books in untidy piles. </li>
			<li> <strong> Above the sofa</strong>, a mariner's chart would fill the whole length of that section of the wall. </li>
			</ul>

			On the <strong> other side of a small low table, </strong> and <strong> beneath a silk prayer-mat </strong> nailed to the wall with three <em> large-headed brass studs, matching the leather curtain, </em> there would be another sofa, at right angles to the first, with a light-brown  velvet covering;it would lead on to a small and spindly piece of furniture, lacquered in dark red and providing three display shelves for <strong>knick-knacks</strong> : 
			<ol>
			<li> agates and stone eggs, </li>
			<li> snuffboxes, </li>
			<li> candy-boxes, </li>
			<li> jade ashtrays, </li>
			<li> a mother-of-pearl oystershell, </li>
			<li> a silver fob watch, </li>
			<li> a cut-glass glass, </li>
			<li> a crystal pyramid, </li>
			<li> a miniature in an oval frame. </li>
			</ol>
			Further on, <strong> beyond a padded door,</strong> there would be shelving on both sides of the corner, 
			<ul>
				<li> for caskets and for records, beside a </li>
				<li> closed gramophone of which only four machinedsteel knobs would be visible, </li>
				<li> and above it, a print depicting The Great Parade of the Military Tattoo. </li>
			</ul>

			<strong> Through the window,</strong> draped with white and brown curtains in cloth imitating Jouy wallpaper, 
			<ul>
				<li> you would glimpse a few trees, </li>
				<li> a tiny park,</li>
				<li> a bit of street. </li>
			</ul>

			A <strong> rolltop desk </strong> littered with 
			<ul>
				<li> papers and pen-holders</li>
				<li> would go with a small cane-seated chair. </li>
			</ul>

			On a <strong> console table </strong> would be a 
			<ol>
					<li> telephone, </li>
				<li> a leather diary, </li>
				<li> a writing pad. </li>
			</ol>


			Then, on the other side of another door, beyond a low, square revolving bookcase supporting a large, 
			<strong> cylindrical vase </strong> decorated in blue and filled with yellow roses, set beneath an oblong mirror in a mahogany frame, there would be a <br>narrow table with its two benches upholstered in tartan, which would bring your eye back to the <strong> leather curtain.</strong> 

			<p> 
			It would be all in 
			<ul>
			<li> browns, </li>
			<li> ochres, </li>
			<li> duns and </li>
			<li> yellows:</li>
			</ul>
			a world of slightly dull colours, in carefully graded shades, calculated with almost too much artistry, in the midst of which would be some <strong>
			striking, brighter splashes</strong> - 
			<ul>
				<li> a cushion in almost garish orange, </li>
				<li> a few multicoloured book jackets amongst the leather-bound volumes. </li>
			</ul>

			During the day, the light  flooding in would make this room seem a little sad, despite the roses. It would be an evening room.
			But in the winter, with the curtains drawn, some spots illuminated - the bookcase corner, the record shelves, the desk, the low table between  the two settees, and the vague reflections in the mirror — and large expanses in shadow, whence all the things would gleam  
			the polished wood, the rich, heavy silks, the cut glass, the softened leather — it would be a haven of peace, 

			<h2>a land of happiness.</h2>


			<p> The first door would open onto a bedroom, its floor covered with a light-coloured fitted carpet. 
			An English double bed would fill the whole rear part of it. On the right, to both sides of the window, 
			there would be tall and narrow sets of <strong> shelves holding </strong>
			<ol>
				<li> a few books, to be read and read again, </li>
				<li> photograph albums, </li>
				<li> packs of cards,</li>
				<li>  pots, </li>
				<li> necklaces, </li>
				<li> paste jewellery. </li>
			</ol>
						
			To the left, an old oak wardrobe and two clothes horses of wood and brass would stand opposite a small wing-chair 
			upholstered in thin-striped grey silk and a dressing table. Through a half-open door giving on to a <strong> bathroom you would</strong> 
			<ul>
				<li>glimpse thick bathrobes, </li>
				<li>swan-neck taps in solid brass, </li>
				<li>a large adjustable mirror,</li>
				<li>a pair of cutthroat razors and their green leather sheaths, </li>
				<li>bottles, </li>
				<li>horn-handled brushes, </li>
				<li>sponges. </li>
			</ul>

			The bedroom walls would be papered with chintz; the bedspread would be a <strong> tartan blanket.</strong><br>
			A bedside table, with an <em> openwork copper band running round</em> three of its sides, would support 
			a 
			<ol>
			<li> silver candlestick lamp topped with a very pale grey silk shade, </li>
			<li> a square carriage clock, </li>
			<li> a rose in a stem-vase, </li>
			<li> and, on its lower shelf, folded newspapers and some magazines.</li> Further on, at the foot of the bed,
			<li>there would be a big pouf in natural hide. </li>
			</ol>

			At the window, the gauze curtains would slide on brass rods; the thick woollen double curtains would be  
			half drawn. In the halflight the room would still be bright. On the wall, above the bed made up and turned down for the  
			night, between two small wall lamps, the astonishing, long, narrow blackand-white photograph of a bird in the sky would 
			surprise you by its slightly 

			<h2> formal perfection. </h2>
