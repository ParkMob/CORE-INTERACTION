<p> 
Your eye, first of all, would glide over the <strong> grey fitted carpet </strong> in the 
<ol>
<li> narrow </li>
<li> long and </li>
<li> high-ceilinged corridor. </li>
</ol>


Its walls would be <strong> cupboards,</strong> in light-coloured wood, with <strong> fittings of gleaming brass.</strong> </br>
<strong> Three prints,  </strong> depicting,
<ol>
	<li>
respectively, the Derby winner Thunderbird, </li>
<li> a paddle-steamer named Villede-Motitereau, </li>
<li> and a Stephenson locomotive, </li>
</ol>

would lead to a <strong> leather curtain hanging </strong> 
<ul>
<li> on thick, </li>
	<li> black, </li>
	 <li> grainy wooden rings </li> which would slide back at the merest touch. 
	</ul>

There, the <strong> carpet</strong> would give way to an almost 
<ul>
<li> yellow woodblock floor,</li>
<li> partly covered by <strong>  three faded rugs.</strong> </li>
</ul> </p>

<p>  It would be a living room about twenty three feet long by ten feet wide. 
On the <strong> left,</strong> in a <em> kind of recess</em>, there would be a 
<ul>
<li> <storng> large sofa</storng> upholstered in worn black leather, with pale cherrywood bookcases on either side, </br>
	heaped with books in untidy piles. </li>
<li> <strong> Above the sofa</strong>, a mariner's chart would fill the whole length of that section of the wall. </li>
</ul>

On the <strong> other side of a small low table, </strong> and <strong> beneath a silk prayer-mat </strong> nailed to the wall with three <em> large-headed brass studs, <br> 
matching the leather curtain, </em> there would be another sofa, at right angles to the first, with a light-brown  velvet covering;<br> 
 it would lead on to a small and spindly piece of furniture, lacquered in dark red and providing three display shelves for <strong>knick-knacks</strong> : 
<ol>
<li> agates and stone eggs, </li>
<li> snuffboxes, </li>
<li> candy-boxes, </li>
<li> jade ashtrays, </li>
<li> a mother-of-pearl oystershell, </li>
<li> a silver fob watch, </li>
<li> a cut-glass glass, </li>
<li> a crystal pyramid, </li>
<li> a miniature in an oval frame. </li>
</ol>
Further on, <strong> beyond a padded door,</strong> there would be shelving on both sides of the corner, 
<ul>
	<li> for caskets and for records, beside a </li>
	<li> closed gramophone of which only four machinedsteel knobs would be visible, </li>
	<li> and above it, a print depicting The Great Parade of the Military Tattoo. </li>
</ul>

<strong> Through the window,</strong> draped with white and brown curtains in cloth imitating Jouy wallpaper, 
<ul>
	<li> you would glimpse a few trees, </li>
	<li> a tiny park,</li>
	<li> a bit of street. </li>
</ul>

A <strong> rolltop desk </strong> littered with 
<ul>
	<li> papers and pen-holders</li>
	<li> would go with a small cane-seated chair. </li>
</ul>

On a <strong> console table </strong> would be a 
<ol>
		<li> telephone, </li>
	<li> a leather diary, </li>
	<li> a writing pad. </li>
</ol>


Then, on the other side of another door, beyond a low, square revolving bookcase supporting a large, <br>
<strong> cylindrical vase </strong> decorated in blue and filled with yellow roses, set beneath an oblong mirror in a mahogany frame, there would be a <br>narrow table with its two benches upholstered in tartan, which would bring your eye back to the <strong> leather curtain.</strong> <br>

<p> 
It would be all in 
<ul>
<li> browns, </li>
<li> ochres, </li>
<li> duns and </li>
<li> yellows:</li>
</ul>
a world of slightly dull colours, in carefully graded shades, calculated with almost too much artistry, in the midst of which would be some <strong> <br>
striking, brighter splashes</strong> - 
<ul>
	<li> a cushion in almost garish orange, </li>
	<li> a few multicoloured book jackets amongst the leather-bound volumes. </li>
</ul>

During the day, the light  flooding in would make this room seem a little sad, despite the roses. It would be an evening room. <br>
But in the winter, with the curtains drawn, some spots illuminated - the bookcase corner, the record shelves, the desk, the low table <br> between  the two settees, and the vague reflections in the mirror — and large expanses in shadow, whence all the things would gleam  </br>
the polished wood, the rich, heavy silks, the cut glass, the softened leather — it would be a haven of peace, 
<h3>a land of happiness.</h3>



<div class="PARAGRAPH">
<p> The first door would open onto a bedroom, its floor covered with a light-coloured fitted carpet. An English double  </br>
bed would fill the whole rear part of it. On the right, to both sides of the window, there would be tall and narrow sets  </br>
of shelves holding a few books, to be read and read again, photograph albums, packs of cards, pots, necklaces, paste  </br>
jewellery. To the left, an old oak wardrobe and two clothes horses of wood and brass would stand opposite a small wing-chair  </br>upholstered in thin-striped grey silk and a dressing table. Through a half-open door giving on to a bathroom you would  </br>
glimpse thick bathrobes, swan-neck taps in solid brass, a large adjustable mirror, a pair of cutthroat razors and their green </br> leather sheaths, bottles, horn-handled brushes, sponges. The bedroom walls would be papered with chintz; the bedspread  </br>
would be a tartan blanket. A bedside table, with an openwork copper band running round three of its sides, would support </br>
a silver candlestick lamp topped with a very pale grey silk shade, a square carriage clock, a rose in a stem-vase, and,  </br>
on its lower shelf, folded newspapers and some magazines. Further on, at the foot of the bed, there would be a big pouf  </br>
in natural hide. At the window, the gauze curtains would slide on brass rods; the thick woollen double curtains would be  </br>
half drawn. In the halflight the room would still be bright. On the wall, above the bed made up and turned down for the  </br>
night, between two small wall lamps, the astonishing, long, narrow blackand-white photograph of a bird in the sky would  </br>
surprise you by its slightly formal perfection. </p> </div>

<div class="PARAGRAPH2" style="background-color:#F3F3F3; width:850px; ">
<p> The second door would reveal a study. From top to bottom the walls would be lined with books and periodicals with,  </br>
here and there, so as to break the continuity of bindings and jackets, a number of prints, drawings and photographs  </br>
Antonello da Messina's Saint Jerome, a detail from The Triumph of Saint George, one of Piranesi's dungeons, a portrait  </br>
by Ingres, a little pen-and-ink landscape by Klee, a sepia-tint photograph of Renan in his room at the Collège de France,  </br>
a Steinberg department store, Cranach's Melanchthon - pinned to wooden panels set into the shelving. Slightly to the  </br>
left of the window and at a shallow angle would be a long country table covered with a large red blotter. Wooden boxes,  </br>
flat pen-holders and pots of all kinds would hold pencils, paper-clips, staples large and small. A glass tile would serve  </br>
as an ashtray. A circular black leather box decorated with gold-leaf arabesques would be filled with cigarettes. Light  </br>
would come from an old desk-lamp, adjustable only with difficulty, fitted with a green opaline lampshade shaped like a visor. </br>
 On each side of the table, virtually facing each other, would be two high-backed wood and leather armchairs. Still </br>
  further to the left, along the wall, would be a narrow table overflowing with books. A wing-chair in bottle-green  </br>
leather would lead to grey metal filing cabinets and light wooden card-index boxes. On a third, even smaller table would be a  </br>Swedish lamp and a typewriter under its canvas dust-cover. Right at the back would be a narrow bed covered in ultramarine  </br>
velvet and stacked with cushions of all colours. On a painted wooden stand, almost in the middle of the room, there would  </br>
be a globe made of papier-mâché and nickel silver, illustrated in naïf style, a fake antique. Behind the desk, half-hidden  </br>
by the red curtain at the window, would be an oiled-wood ladder which could slide on a brass rail all the way round the room.</p>
</div>

<div class="PARAGRAPH3" style="background-color:#EEEEEE; width:850px;">
<p> There, life would be easy, simple. All the servitudes, all the problems brought by material existence would find a  </br>
natural solution. A cleaning lady would come every morning. Every fortnight, wine, oil and sugar would be delivered. There  </br>
would be a huge, bright kitchen with blue tiles decorated with heraldic emblems, three china plates decorated with yellow  </br>
arabesques in metallic paint, cupboards everywhere, a handsome whitewood table in the middle with stools and bench-seats.  </br>
It would be pleasant to come and sit there, every morning, after a shower, scarcely dressed. On the table there would be a  </br>
sizeable stoneware butter dish, jars of marmalade, honey, toast, grapefruit cut in two. It would be early. It would be May,  </br>
the start of a long summer's day.</p>
</div>

<div class="PARAGRAPH4"  style="background-color:#CCCCCC; width:850px;">
<p> They would open the mail, they would open the newspapers. They would light their first cigarette. They would go out.  </br>
Their work would keep them busy for a few hours only, in the morning. They would meet for lunch, a sandwich or a steak,  </br>
according to their mood; they would have coffee at a street café and then go home, on foot, slowly.</p></div>

<div class="PARAGRAPH5" style="background-color:#999999; width:850px;">
<p> Their flat would rarely be tidy, but its very untidiness would be its greatest charm. They would hardly bother  </br>
themselves with it: they would live in it. The comfort of their surroundings would seem to them to be an established fact, </br>
 a datum, a state of their nature. Their attention would be elsewhere: on the book they would open, on the text they would </br>
  draft, on the record they would listen to, on their dialogue engaged afresh each day. They would work for a long while.  </br>
Then they would dine, or go out for dinner; they would see old friends; they would walk together.</p>
</div>

<div class="PARAGRAPH6" style="background-color:#666666; width:850px;" >

<p> Sometimes it would seem to them that a whole life could be led harmoniously between these book-lined walls, amongst these  </br>objects so perfectly domesticated that they would have ended up believing these bright, soft, simple and beautiful things had  </br>
only ever been made for their sole use. But they wouldn't feel enslaved by them: on some days, they would go off on a chance  </br>adventure. No plan seemed impossible to them. They would not know rancour, or bitterness, or envy. For their means and their  </br>desires would always match in all ways. They would call this balance happiness and, with their freedom, with their wisdom  </br>
and their culture, they would know how to retain and to reveal it in every moment of their living, together.</p>
